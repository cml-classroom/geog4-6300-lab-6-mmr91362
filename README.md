# Geog4/6300: Lab 6

Complete the lab assignment by filling in the template. Knit it to a Github document and then push it up to the Github repo for this assignment. When you're ready to submit, go to the "issues" tab and create a new issue. Use the subject line "Lab 6 complete" and then put "@jshannon75" and your name in the body, along with any other comments you want to share about the assignment. Your grade will be entered below:

* Question 1: Good<p>
* Question 2: Ooh--I like the way you set up the legend here.<p>
* Question 3: I wouldn't say the water percentage is particularly close, and some of the highest pop areas also have high ndvi.<p>
* Question 4: I appreciate doing this as a loop, but the downside is that the models aren't clear about which variable is which. `tidy` from the `broom` package, which we touched on earlier in class, could have been another option here. That really limits your interpretation (what is variable 6?), and you also don't say anything about the magnitude of the model coefficients.<p>
* Question 5: Good<p>
* Question 6: This is better than Q4, though you could still do more to interpret those model coefficients. Is the coefficient for population big? It's only for a one person increase, so it would naturally be a small number. But given that, is its overall effect notable?<p>
* Question 7: You do an OK job on normality of residuals, but don't talk about the map--this is brought up later in Q9, but could be more explicit here..<p>
* Question 8: Good<p>
* Question 9: What are the meaningful results, briefly? You don't say which variable seem most important.<p>

* Challenge:<p>
<p>
General feedback: This will be marked as incomplete due to the issues in Q4, Q7, and Q9. Those shouldn't take too long, but they're important for developing good interpretations of your models.
